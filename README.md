# Chat N' Dash!

Chat with new friends from all over the globe! But do it quickly, you've only got 60 seconds!

### What does our app do?

Inspired by the web app Chatroulette, our app creates a Peer to Peer connection between two users. However, the video connection between the users is set at only 60 seconds before expiring, so the conversation has to roll quickly! If users enjoy the conversation, they are able to "Favorite" it, which is stored in our database. If the Favorite is mutual, the username and date of the chat get stored and displayed on the home page.

### New Components We Used
